## Styling Guide

The extension comes with a standalone HTML version that can be used for styling purposes. Any styles applied to the standalone version (except width-related properties) will work in both the standalone and extension versions.

### What Can Be Styled

1. Typography
   - Font sizes, families, and weights
   - Line heights
   - Text colors
   - Text overflow/ellipsis behavior

2. Colors
   - Background colors
   - Text colors
   - Border colors
   - Hover state colors
   - Played/unplayed state colors

3. Spacing and Layout (except width-related)
   - Padding and margins
   - Grid gap adjustments
   - Row heights
   - Vertical spacing between sections

4. Visual Effects
   - Border styles
   - Border radius
   - Box shadows
   - Opacity
   - Transitions/animations
   - Hover/active states

5. Icons and Controls
   - Play/pause button appearance
   - Checkbox styles
   - Toggle arrow appearance
   - Button hover effects

6. Section Styling
   - Feed header backgrounds
   - Episode row backgrounds
   - Separator lines
   - Column header appearance

7. Player Controls
   - Audio player button colors
   - Progress bar colors
   - Volume control appearance

### Important Notes

- Do not modify any width-related properties (width, min-width, max-width) as these need to stay fixed for proper extension behavior
- The standalone version is purely for styling purposes and does not include actual functionality
- All styling should be done through CSS to ensure consistency between both versions
